The 365 Data Challenge Project
Name: Le Luu

Goal for this challenge: analyze an attraction of a database on student engagement and identify key areas of improvement.
•	There are 39.19% of students purchased monthly subscriptions while most of the Annual subscription purchases. The quarterly purchase takes a small percentage. 
In terms of purchase type, U.S is the country that has over 300 purchases. 
It shows that the U.S is a good market for learning courses online. The other countries don’t have many purchases as in the U.S. 
I think we can consider developing the marketing, opening more courses with diverse languages in subtitles such as in India, Nigeria, and Singapore. 
Those are markets that have some purchases of 365 data science courses.
•	From the beginning of the year 2022 until October 2022, most students registered for the Introduction to Data and Data Science course and some basic courses for the Data Science path. 
The number of students who enrolled for higher courses is not much. 
The basic courses usually take about 4 hours or less to watch the full course while the higher courses usually take about over 6 hours. 
It could affect the motivation of students while learning online. 
Depending on the background and the time of each student, the student will consider choosing the course to take. 
•	Overall, most courses have a high rating number (over 4.2/5). Data-Driven Business Growth has the lowest rating. 
That course also has the smallest number of students registered. It should be an outlier because not many students rated for the course. 
In terms of enrolling in the course, students could take some courses too high if they haven’t taken the requisite courses. 
Students could feel low motivated if they can’t catch up with the course. 
We can consider recommending taking some basic courses before taking high-level courses.
•	The number of students who answer the quiz correctly is 25.9% while the number of those answering incorrectly is 74.1%. 
The quiz could be a challenge for students if students don’t pay much attention to the course or if the quiz is too hard for students to answer in a short time. 
We can consider the challenge level of the quiz in the course. We could consider the questions from easy to medium hard and give some hints about the place where they can find the answer from the course. 
•	Most students do the practice exam with an average point is 83/100. The average exam result in the course exam is 85.65/100. 
Those are good numbers. It reflects how students understand the course. 
I like the method of taking the exam in 365 Data Science. 
If students failed the course exam, they need to watch the course videos again in 30 minutes. 
It helps students to look back on what they have learned. On the other side, it could affect some students who only made some mistakes during the exam time. 
It would take their time to watch the video again in 30 minutes. 
In this case, we could consider showing some topics that could help to answer the question and show the video which could help them to answer that wrong question. 
•	According to the visualization on the top right side, students who watch the video longer, might have high average exam results. 
The top courses that have high average exam results are short-length courses (about 4 hours or less). 
It is easy for the student to watch the video again before taking the exam. 
The average completion time of each course is less than about 2 times the exam duration time. We could consider balancing the points and the time of each question in the exam. 
It helps to avoid students choosing randomly for skipping the questions in the exam. 
•	According to the visualization, most students who have the number of hub questions from 4 to 9 questions and complete the exam in a long time have medium average exam results. 
Some students who have more hub questions do not have high exam results. 
They might get into trouble during learning the course. We could consider a forum for students to ask and answer. 
The feedback is also good for students to learn and understand the challenge.

•	On the right corner is the comparison between 3 visualizations. 
Mostly, students who join in all engagement quizzes, exams, and lessons have high average exam results than other students who miss one engagement exam or lesson. 
We can consider encouraging students to join in those engagement quizzes, exams, and lessons by giving coins. 
365 Data Science already had a system to count the coins after taking the quiz, and exams.
But we can consider exchanging the coins into getting coupons or some percentage for buying courses on the system.

Recommendations:
•	Consider developing the marketing fields to introduce data science to other pages, and social media and improving the subtitle of videos with more languages.
•	For long-duration courses, consider splitting them into small courses (4 hours). If students pass the exam of those small courses, they can get a certificate.
•	Make a question list for students to choose the career path after taking the Introduction to Data and Data Science Course. 
They could choose the path to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineering, or Machine Learning field. 
Then, recommend courses following the chosen path. 
•	Consider balancing the duration of exam time and the difficulty level of the quiz, and exam. 
•	If the students get failed in the quiz, or exams, consider giving some hints, topics, and videos to review.
•	Develop a forum, so students can ask questions and give feedback to other students. Some might have the same questions in the course. 
Students can also learn from each other. Giving some coins if students gave helpful feedback and received more likes from other students.
•	Encouraging students to join in engagement quizzes, exams, and lessons by giving coins and exchanging coins for coupons to buy courses.
